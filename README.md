Responsive Card Layout using Atomic CSS

This project is a static web page that showcases a modern, responsive card layout. It is built entirely with HTML and CSS, following an Atomic CSS (or utility-first) methodology. Each class has a single, specific purpose, demonstrating how to build a complex and clean design by composing these utilities.


Key Features :-

Responsive Grid: The layout seamlessly adjusts from a 3-column grid on desktops, to 2 columns on tablets, and a single column on mobile devices.

Atomic CSS Approach: All styling is done through small, reusable, single-purpose classes, making the code easy to manage and scale.

Card Component Design: Clean and modern card design featuring an image, title, descriptive text, and a call-to-action button.

CSS Grid: The core layout is powered by CSS Grid for robust and flexible alignment.

Hover Effects: Interactive hover effect on buttons for better user experience.
